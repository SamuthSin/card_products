                    <p>TBuilt with a durable anti-shock rubber case, the iron grey 500GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive
                        from Transcend combines a 500GB storage capacity with a USB 3.0 interface, 256-bit AES file
                        encryption, and military-grade shock resistance. The internal 2.5" hard drive receives further
                        protection from a suspension system, while a one-touch auto-backup button helps to create a
                        second copy of your data and a quick reconnect button re-enables the removed hard drive without
                        needing to remove and reinsert the USB cable. Power is provided via the USB bus, and compatible
                        operating systems include Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
